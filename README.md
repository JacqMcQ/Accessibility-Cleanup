# Description
Challenge 1: UT Austin Coding Bootcamp- Tasked with refactoring the starter code to make the client's site more accessible. By adding semantic elements and updating the code, the overall accessibility of the website has been improved. Descriptions were provided for all impages in order to improve usage of the site. The first step was updating the index.html to include more specific semantic elements. As the html was being updated, any necessary updates to the CSS file were completed. A link on the page was prepared so that the UI would navigate to the correct section of the page. Flex box design was implemented to best align the content of the page.
